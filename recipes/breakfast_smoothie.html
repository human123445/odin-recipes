        <p>I like to make a smoothie every morning for breakfast.</p>
        <p>Most if the ingredients are interchangable, so don't worry too much about measuring.</p>
        <p><em>It's alot of fun to experiment with new fruits!</em></p>
        
    <h3><strong>Tools You Will Need.</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blender</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>    
        <p><strong>AVOID USING FRUITS OR JUICES WITH CITRUS. THIS CAN CAUSE THE MILK TO CURDLE.</strong></p>    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Base</strong> A fiber rich fruit or veggie that will add thickness to your smoothie. (<em>I like to use banannas or mangos</em>)</em></li>
            <li><strong>The Flavors</strong> I like to add strawberries, blueberries, and rasberries, but the possabilities are endless.</li>
            <li><strong>The Juice</strong> I use milk, but you can use any fruit juice or even water!</li>
        </ul>
