        <p>I like to make a smoothie every morning for breakfast.</p>
        <p>Most if the ingredients are interchangable, so don't worry too much about measuring.</p>
        <p><em>It's alot of fun to experiment with new fruits!</em></p>

    <h2>Tools You Will Need.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blender</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Ingredients.</h2>    
        <p><strong>AVOID USING FRUITS OR JUICES WITH CITRUS. THIS CAN CAUSE THE MILK TO CURDLE.</strong></p>    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Base</strong> A fiber rich fruit or veggie that will add thickness to your smoothie. (<em>I like to use banannas or mangos</em>)</em></li>
            <li><strong>The Flavors</strong> I like to add strawberries, blueberries, and rasberries, but the possabilities are endless.</li>
            <li><strong>The Juice</strong> I use milk, but you can use any fruit juice or even water!</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Optional Ingredients.</h3>
    <p>I like to add protein and fats to my smoothies! It gives me the energy I need to make it through my morning!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein Powder</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Yogurt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Coconut Oil</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>      
    <ol>
        <li>Start adding your <strong>Base</strong> fruits or veggies (<em>this is a good time to add any optional ingredients</em>).</li>
        <li>Add what <strong>Flavors</strong> you would like to have. I normally throw in a handful of strawberries, or some blackberries when they're in season!</li>
        <li>Fill the blender with <strong>Milk, Juice, or Water</strong> to the top of the fruits or veggies.</li>
        <li>Last blend until you get your desired consistancy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Enjoy</h2>
    <p>Sit back and enjoy your smoothie! (<em>It tastes better with a straw!</em>)</p>
